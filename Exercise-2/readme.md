Design the architecture for collecting logs from services, which can push logs via Loki into Grafana, including:

1. Storing these logs in a file system (such as HDFS, S3, etc.);
2. Identifying critical logs, such as issues in certain services;
3. Pushing these alerts into a messaging platform and storing them in a database for analysis.

The deliverable for this task is a diagram or schema of the architecture with comments.
